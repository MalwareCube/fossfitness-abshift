//homeButton - onClick, set level state back to 0, which will re-render the Welcome component / reset the app
//There will be a setLevelState function or whatever to control the entire app. Timers will trigger it to progress. Hitting "previous exercise" etc. will subtract one level state, progress one, etc.
// 0: home page, 1: after clicking begin. This component autogenerates the workout, 2: first exercise... etc: 10: Congrats component
// each level will have its own component state that doesn't need to be global. Etc: timer for each exercise, etc.
// on second thought, maybe workouts will be generated as global state. The reshuffle button will trigger shuffleWorkout or setWorkout function.
// The workout variable will be an object that all workout components will need to access workout.name workout.gif workout.time etc
//will need master array of objects for every single exercise - then the generated Workout array of objects will be the one for the app's iteration 
// workout - array of objects {
//    name: "Russian V Tuck Twists",
//    time: 30
